# Facebook Demo

This is Ryan Sims' Facebook App that demonstrates usage of animations and transitions between views.

Time spent: 9-10 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:
* &#10004; Tapping on a photo in the news feed should expand the photo full screen.
* &#10004; Tapping the Done button should animate the photo back into its position in the news feed.
* &#10004; On scroll of the full screen photo, the background should start to become transparent, revealing the feed.
* &#10004; If the user scrolls a large amount and releases, the full screen photo should dismiss.
* &#10004; Optional: The full screen photo should be zoomable.

Note:
I ended up using a pan gesture to simulate the scrolling of the photo modal view. I couldn't get the offsets quite right. I also used double-tap and some location of the touches to simulate a zoom effect.
